                <h3>My Journey</h3>
                <p>I’m Daksh Hande, a driven entrepreneur and ground staff at Pune Airport since January 2025. My journey blends a passion for aviation, business, and strategic thinking through chess. With an international FIDE chess rating of 1441, I bring precision and focus to both my professional and personal pursuits.</p>
                <p>I previously founded Retroweb.space, a global tech and business news platform that delivered top-notch content. Despite its innovative approach, the venture faced challenges with revenue and was shut down on March 16, 2025. This experience fueled my resilience and sharpened my business acumen.</p>
                <p>Currently pursuing a BBA after completing high school in 2024, I’m laying the foundation for a new media venture in 2025. My strong communication skills and business expertise drive my vision to create impactful projects. Beyond work, I’m committed to philanthropy, with plans to support education and environmental causes in Western countries starting in 2027, aspiring to collaborate with organizations like the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation.</p>
                <p>Featured on platforms like Wikiquote, I maintain a modest online presence while focusing on real-world impact. Explore my career, passions, and future goals through this site.</p>
