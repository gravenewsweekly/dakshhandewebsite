                <h3>My Commitment to Giving Back</h3>
                <p>I, Daksh Hande, am passionate about making a difference in the world through philanthropy. My focus is on supporting education and environmental causes in Western countries, with a vision to provide access to quality education and promote sustainable environmental practices.</p>

                <h4>Future Plans</h4>
                <p>Starting in 2027, I plan to launch initiatives that address educational disparities and environmental challenges. My goal is to create programs that empower communities through knowledge and protect our planet for future generations. I aspire to collaborate with impactful organizations, such as the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, to amplify these efforts.</p>

                <h4>Current Projects</h4>
                <p>As of now, I am in the planning phase and have no active philanthropy projects. My focus is on building a strong foundation for my initiatives, ensuring they are impactful and sustainable when launched.</p>

                <h4>Past Charitable Work</h4>
                <p>I have not yet engaged in formal charitable work, but my commitment to philanthropy is a core part of my long-term vision. I am actively preparing to contribute meaningfully in the future.</p>

                <h4>Get Involved</h4>
                <p>While my initiatives are still in development, I welcome opportunities to connect with like-minded individuals and organizations. Together, we can work toward a brighter, more sustainable future.</p>
